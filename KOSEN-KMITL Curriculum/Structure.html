        <h2>5-Year Intense Curriculum</h2>
        <p>Our program is designed to transform 15-year-old students into professional engineers by the age of 20.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3><span class="highlight">Year 1: Foundations</span></h3>
            <p>
                The first year focuses on building a strong foundation in Mathematics, Physics, and English.
                Students are introduced to basic engineering concepts and the "Monozukuri" (art of making things)
                philosophy.
                Laboratories include basic circuit analysis and workshop practice.
            </p>
            <p>Key Subjects: Calculus I, Physics for Engineers, Intro to Programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3><span class="highlight">Year 2: Specialized Core</span></h3>
            <p>
                Students begin to dive deeper into their chosen majors (Mechatronics, Computer, Electrical).
                More complex projects are introduced. The curriculum aligns strictly with the NIT (National Institute of
                Technology) Japan standard.
            </p>
            <p>Key Subjects: Digital Circuits, Mechanics, Advanced Programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3><span class="highlight">Year 3: Advanced Application</span></h3>
            <p>
                The coursework becomes heavily project-based. Students learn to apply theoretical knowledge to solve
                real-world problems.
                Interdisciplinary projects are encouraged to foster teamwork and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>Key Subjects: Microcontrollers, Control Systems, Signal Processing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3><span class="highlight">Year 4: Research & Development</span></h3>
            <p>
                Students start working on pre-graduation projects and engage in research.
                Advanced topics such as AI, IoT, and Robotics are covered in depth.
            </p>
            <p>Key Subjects: Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Industrial Automation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3><span class="highlight">Year 5: Graduation & Internship</span></h3>
            <p>
                The final year emphasizes the Capstone Project and Industrial Internship.
                Students spend significant time in the industry to gain practical experience.
                Many students also have the opportunity to participate in exchange programs with KOSEN colleges in
                Japan.
            </p>
            <p>Key Subjects: Capstone Project, Seminar, Industrial Training.</p>
